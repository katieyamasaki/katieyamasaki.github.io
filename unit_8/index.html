					<h2>Testimonials</h2>
					<p>Yuki Momo is the best kitten therapist I have ever met. Simply gazing into her brilliant blue eyes instantly calms my anxiety. - Marcia B.</p>
					<br>
					<p>When my wife signed us up for Yuki Momo's couple's therapy, I was a cynical skeptic to say the least. Yet, Yuki hands-down saved our marriage and we're happier than ever. - Anonymous</p>
					<br>
					<p>I came to Yuki at a real low point in my life. Each session was a different exercise; sometimes she had me feed her, sometimes she sat on my chest and purred, other times we'd just talk it out. It's remarkable how healing those sessions were, and I'm forever grateful for her. - Bobby K.</p>
